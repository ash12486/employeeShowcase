## Project Description
This website is a showcase of my projects used as a portfolio to any prospective employer.

This project uses css grid, hover selectors, and extensive css code. The website gives the employer a clean view of who the employee is, what projects they've done, and their contact information. 

I am brand new to all of this, so there were many challenges along the way.  But I really like the organization of css grid, it makes it a lot easier to understand how a web layout is imagined. 

The links all work, however, I added a blank html page as a placeholder for either a future project's landing page, or for an external resume. 

## Credits

I definitely had the help of youtube, CSS-trisks.com, and stackoverflow.  I learned about css grids from a few different youtube videos, and got help on aligning text within the css grids from stackoverflow.
